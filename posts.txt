%T Building a homemade Go-Kart using a salvaged treadmill motor
%p With an arduino, I was able to control the salvaged linear actuator, motor, and motor controller of a salvaged treadmill. With this set up, I attempted to create a working go-kart.

%t Slippery when panickin', this seems like surfin' gasoline at the mercy of my discrepancy I've got countless current identities Which one should I pretend to be? Which will be the end of me? Fuck my present coordinates I will 'em dead like, like, like, like, like, like, like it's not what you think fuck you want from us? We're the same as you but we know we're fucked but we came as you, like you know it's us and your mind, not you

%T Decoding radio transmissions received by a consumer Software-Defined Radio
%p I used a 25 dollar software-defined radio connected to homemade antennas in order to receive radio transmissions from airplanes and satellites.

%t Using a couple  <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com">RTL-SDR Blog</a>  V3 software defined radios, homemade antennas, and free software, I was able to download and interpret radio communications from both airplanes and satellites. To make this sound less scary, I could listen to airplanes and satellites when they talk to something else.
%t I could download <a href="https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/programs/adsb/">ADS-B</a> data, which contains an aircraft's location, registration, height, route, and speed, then plot that using  <a href="https://github.com/MalcolmRobb/dump1090">dump1090</a> and <a href="http://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk/">Virtual Radar Server</a>. The data was received by the SDR plugged into a computer on one side and a groundplane antenna tuned to 1090 mHz on the other end. I also downloaded pictures from weather satellites including NOAA-15, NOAA-18, NOAA-19, and GOES-16. The NOAA series are polar orbitting satellites meaning they pass over the poles every hour and a half or so. To receive this data, I had to build a QFH (Quadrafilar Helix) antenna with PVC piping and speaker wire. This could not be received with a standard antenna because the data is helically polarized. This antenna is seen on the right. The GOES satellite is one of two geostationary weather satellites that NOAA has in orbit. It takes high definition photos of Earth and transmits that <a href="https://www.noaasis.noaa.gov/GOES/HRIT/lrit.html">LRIT</a> data which contains the picture the satellite took. This can lead to some stunning and impressively clear photos of our planet. Below are a couple of them.
